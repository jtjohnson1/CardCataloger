# CardCataloger

CardCataloger is a web-based application designed to manage and catalog scanned sports and non-sports card collections. Using AI image recognition, the app processes paired front and back card images to extract card details and provides price comparisons from various online marketplaces, including eBay.

## Overview

CardCataloger is organized into two main parts: frontend and backend.

### Architecture and Technologies

- **Frontend**:
  - Developed using ReactJS and Vite.
  - Integrated with Shadcn-UI component library and Tailwind CSS.
  - Client-side routing with `react-router-dom`.
  - All frontend API requests are directed to backend endpoints starting with `/api/`.

- **Backend**:
  - Built with ExpressJS implementing REST API endpoints.
  - Uses MongoDB with Mongoose for database operations.
  - Integrated with various third-party services for AI image processing, price comparison, and data extraction.

### Project Structure

- `client/`: Contains the ReactJS frontend code.
  - `src/pages/`: Contains page components.
  - `src/components/`: Contains reusable components.
  - `src/api/`: Contains API request definitions and mock data.

- `server/`: Contains the ExpressJS server code.
  - `api/`: Contains the API endpoints.
  - `models/`: Defines the MongoDB schemas.
  - `services/`: Contains service classes for business logic.

## Features

### Main Dashboard
- Clean and modern web interface.
- Displays system health status such as Ollama connection and database status.

### Card Processing
- Directory browser to select source directory with card images.
- Real-time progress monitoring with error logging.
- Processes paired front and back card images using AI for detail extraction.

### Card Database
- Sortable and filterable table displaying processed cards.
- Detailed card view with manual edit capability.
- Price comparison from multiple online sources.

### Settings
- Configure API credentials for eBay and other marketplaces.
- Connection settings for Ollama and GPU configuration.
- Maintenance tools such as backup and restore options.
